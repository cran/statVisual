  (1) revised back Dependency to R 3.5.0 since Writting R extension document mentions that
  "It is inadvisable to use a dependence on R with patchlevel (the third digit) other than
zero. Doing so with packages which others depend on will cause the other packages to become
unusable under earlier versions in the series, and e.g. versions 3.x.1 are widely used throughout the Northern Hemisphere academic year."

  (1) Dependency R 3.5.2
